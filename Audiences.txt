Depending on the background of different people, you address different things:

Portfolio:
-Link to website. :)

Website:
-Addressing people that would either use our product or would use our code.
-We want to have understandable stuff for people that don't know the PYTHONS.
-Have the output of our code, lot of pictures, correlations, graphs, etc, and then have the code available through github so that in-depth pythoners can see how things happen.

Poster:
-Pictures illustrating data
-Architecture of code / data classes
-Math backing up our ML stuff / correlations stuff
-No code, that is weird on a poster
